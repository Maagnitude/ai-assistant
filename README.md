# AI Assistant

Important: To use the music features, you must have your own Spotify client_id, client_secret and access_token.

* Call Jarvis by saying "Jarvis", "Hey", or "Is anyone there?"

-> Jarvis will respond, and then you'll have to ask him what you want.

## Examples
* You can say:

1. Play some music. He will ask you the song, and you just have to name it.
2. Stop -> to pause the song that's currently played.
3. Resume -> To resume a paused song.
4. Open browser -> Opens google.com
5. Search for (the query) -> Googles the query.
6. Communication check -> Checks if Jarvis hears you.
7. What's up? -> Question to the AI.
8. You're dismissed -> AI salutes you, and the app is terminated.
9. f*** you -> For fun.
10. nothing -> nothing
